## Overview

The **Resume NLP Parser** revolutionizes the recruitment process by employing sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This tool efficiently extracts, analyzes, and visualizes data from resumes, enabling data-driven decision-making in hiring. Tailored for both candidates and recruiters, it enhances the application experience by parsing resumes comprehensively and offering powerful insights.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Resume Parsing**: Extracts detailed information including contact details, skills, work experience, and educational background from resumes in PDF formats.

- **Advanced NLP Analysis**: Utilizes leading-edge NLP libraries such as NLTK and spaCy to delve into resume text, identifying keywords, phrases, and patterns to evaluate candidates' qualifications comprehensively.

- **Intuitive Data Visualization**: Presents parsed data through interactive visualizations, empowering recruiters with efficient insights into applicants' profiles.

- **Robust Search and Filtering**: Offers powerful search and filtering functionalities, enabling swift access to specific candidate information.

## Technologies Used

The project leverages the following technologies and tools:

- **Python**: Primary programming language for NLP, data analysis, and backend functionalities.
- **NLP Libraries**: Utilizes NLTK and spaCy for text analysis, named entity recognition (NER), and text parsing.
- **Web Interface**: Employs Streamlit to create a user-friendly web-based interface for seamless user interaction.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilizes Matplotlib and Plotly for generating informative and interactive visualizations.
- **Database Management**: Utilizes SQLite for efficiently managing and querying resume data.
- **Model Training**: Incorporates spaCy's NER pipeline for training models on customized data for skill extraction.

## Functionalities

### User

The User section allows individuals to upload their resumes. The system then extracts and displays parsed information, showcasing extracted details such as skills, work experience, education, and contact information.

### Recruiters

Recruiters can upload multiple resumes and specify desired skills. The system performs skill-based searching across the resumes, presenting the findings in a structured format for better evaluation.

### Feedback

This section enables users to provide feedback, suggestions, or improvements for the system's enhancement. Users can share their thoughts on improving parsing accuracy, user interface, or additional functionalities.

### Admin

Admins have privileged access, requiring authentication to access this section. They can review uploaded resumes, manage feedback received from users, and download uploaded resumes for further analysis or archiving.

## Future Enhancements

In the pipeline for this project are several enhancements:

- **Machine Learning Integration**: Integrate machine learning algorithms to enhance resume analysis and categorization.
- **Customization Features**: Offer customization options for tailoring parsing algorithms to specific job roles or industries.
- **Database Integration and Management**: Implement a more robust database system for long-term storage and efficient data retrieval.
